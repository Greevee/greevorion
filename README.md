Descr.:
Hi, my Name is Greeve and this is my first mod.
I love Avorion, but I hate the progression and balance. This mod will slow everything down. The progress is more linear, the fights last longer. I created the mod because i looted a 500k dps instaburst cannon that killed the balance for me. Maybe you feel the same.

What the mod offers:
- all vanilla weapons were removed and replaced by 16 new weapon types with their own modifiers and scaling, some weapons have subweapon types (some can be seen in screenshots)
- most of the vanilla upgrades were removed and many systems were added (some can be seen in screenshots)
- enemies get a bit larger in size, more weapons, feels a bit more epic
- weapon dps scales slower and less random, but you get more turret slots
- many small tweaks like fighter velocity buff, salvage size, scrapyard license duration
- pirates get harder closer to the center
